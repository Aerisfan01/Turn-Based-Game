Idea for the SAT 

1)
- Turn based game like Pokemon or Final Fantasy with a seed like generation and multiple enemies 
- Betterdiscord theme written in CSS 
- Basic game?

2) The game will be built apon the FF7 type of battle system since its famillar to me and my interest in ff7 is huge. Frank said this was good 
if things go sideways the discord theme can be used as it can help people with customization with their client and what they want on it 


3) The constraints may include the right amount of balancing in the game when stats are implemented. Technically it will be run in the terminal unless i can make the game with a pokemon style full screen with graphics but im not sure about this 

4) Im not sure at this point in time
